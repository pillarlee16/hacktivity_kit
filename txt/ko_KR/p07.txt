어떻게 핵 잼을 홍보할까

어떤 핵 잼들은 소수의 참가자들만 있는 반면에, 다른 행사들은 더 큰 규모가 될 수 있는 잠재력을 가지고 있기도 합니다. 이 섹션은 대규모 행사를 홍보하는데 필요한 노력들을 가르쳐줄 것입니다.

5 - 10 talking points

여러분과 여러분의 핵심 계획 팀은 여러분이 하고 있는 일을 공개적으로 말하기를 원할 것입니다. 여러분의 메시지를 일관된 언어로 의사소통하는 것은 중요합니다. 이를 하기 위한 한가지 방법은 여러분의 행사의 중점, 구조 그리고 목표를 설명하는데 도움이 되는 5-10개의 문장이나 아이디어를 만드는 것입니다. We've included talking points to use below -- feel free to borrow or put in your own words.

Craft a news release

A news release is usually a one-page document describing your event, your organization and anything noteworthy that you might want to communicate. This document should be carefully written as reporters will refer to it when writing their stories. Be sure to include links to websites and other resources connected to your event. Finally, remember to include clear contact information so that members of the media know who to follow up with.

Beef up your contacts

Create a mailing list and send out the news release at least a week before the event. As well as mainstream media outlets in your community — newspapers, TV and radio — think about other outlets and organizations that potentially could spread the word about your hack jam. This might be parent groups, techie meet-ups, bloggers, podcasters, tweeters, etc. If any these contacts follow up with you, remember to be honest. Relying on your talking points will help guide you through the conversation or email. To be ready for the sorts of questions they’ll likely ask, see our list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Leverage social media

Show the world what you are up to with consistent posts to social media sites including: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube/ Vimeo and blogs. Get creative and make your own buzz in these spaces. You can make your own promotional videos or how-to tutorials and publicize these on the Hackasaurus site and/or through your own distribution channels.
